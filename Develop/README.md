## Description

- What was your motivation?
Refractoring Horison's website and improving accessibility with HTML and CSS.

Built this project in order to refractor the existing website and improving accessibility, in order for their website to be more optimized for search engines.

- What problem does it solve?
Website meets accessibility standards by adding accessible alt attributes and making sure elements follow structure.

- What did you learn?
